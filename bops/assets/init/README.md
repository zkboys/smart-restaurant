        branch: 'master' } } }
```

```
$ scion list

   { 'my-tpl-name':
      { url: 'https://gitxxx/somebody/my-tpl.git',
        branch: 'master' } } }
```

### init | i
After adding new templates, you could use this command to generate your own project by choosing template.
```
$ scion init

/* enter a template name which was added by yourself */
Template name: my-tpl-name

/* your project name */

 cd my-new-project && npm install

```
$ scion delete
```
and type the template name you want to delete:
```
Template name: my-tpl-name
```
if the name exist, you will see:
```

The last template list is:

{ tpl:
   { 'my-tpl-name': undefined } }
```
once a template is `undefined`, it means you've deleted it successfully.

# Template
The most important part of Scion is `template`. All templates' infomation were list in the `templates.json`.
A template means a project sample, which has a simple or complex file structure.

You can create your own templates repository, and push your templates in different branches. All you need to do then is to add the templates into Scion's `templates.json`.
